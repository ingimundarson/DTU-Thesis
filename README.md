# Self-Organizing Maps and Strategic Fund Selection

A Study on the Synergy of Machine Learning and Graph Theory Algorithms. 

## Description

This GitHub repository contains the code for a Master's thesis project conducted at Denmark's Technical University (DTU), on the synergy between Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and traditional machine learning methods for strategic fund selection. The project specifically focuses on the combination of SOMs with Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. The optimization model used to evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the generated ETF subsets was constructed by [Petr Vanek](https://github.com/VanekPetr) and utilizes a stochastic CVaR optimization model. The results showed promise for the synergy between SOMs and MST but not for the combination of SOMs and AHC.
